the questions are:
Q1. Class A,B,C,D,E
Q2.What is CIDR?
Q3.reserve ip address
Q4.100 inbound ports



A1.
Class A	IP address 1 to 126,  default subnet mask .255.0.0
   
Class B	IP address 128 to 191,  default subnet mask .255.255.0

   Class C	IP address 192 to 223,  default subnet mask .255.255.255


   Class D	IP address 224 to 239,  default subnet mask .N/A (multicast)
   
Class E	IP address 240 to 255,  default subnet mask .N/A
 (reserve)




A2.CIDR reduced the problem of wasted address space by providing a new and more flexible way to specify network addresses in routers. This is much like how the public telephone system uses area codes to channel calls toward a certain part of the network.

A3.In the Internet addressing architecture, the Internet Engineering Task Force and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority have specifically reserved various IP addresses for special designated purposes.
